# SkiOregon_public

Michael Chen & Chris Kesting

A simple database driven web application for Oregon State University CS 340 class portfolio
project.

MySQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js

SkiOregon! (SO!) partners with all 15 ski resorts in the great state of Oregon. The SO! website is
a backend operated by the resorts which enables skiers and boarders to find information about
and purchase day passes at any Oregon ski resort. Once a decision to purchase a pass has
been made, the website can create a transaction for a specific customer. Passes can be added
to the transaction. Each resort has its own day pass cost.
